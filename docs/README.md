# G2MILP

## Introduction
**G2MILP** is the first deep generative framework for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) instances.
This framework can learn to generate novel and realistic MILP instances without prior expert-designed formulations, while preserving the structures and computational hardness of real-world datasets, simultaneously.
Additionally, it is employed to generate challenging instances for benchmarking and research purposes.
**G2MILP** offers a data-centric approach to enhancing MILP solver development, particularly in scenarios with limited data availability.
